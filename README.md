I realized a nice idea for next pet project. Kind of probably small, but nevertheless nice.

Minecraft server deployable with infrastructure as a code
with some backend keeping track of incoming and leaving server players -> counting current players online
and attaching ChatOps bot to it.
If players all players are offline for more than 5 minutes = automaticlaly shutting down server
any player in discord server can boot it up by ChatOps command back online and join it
Thus. It would be my kind of small minecraft server among friends, yet with minimum payment, paying only for when some players are playing (edited)

Minecraft servers with fifty+ mods are kind of just too costy to server resources. Preferably they demand at least 4 CPU, 8 RAM even for small server for few people xD

It will automatically also kind of solve a problem that minecraft server needs to be restarted at least once a day, due to all memory leaks xD

Actually for next versions: make minecraft as service with panel to control and sell
