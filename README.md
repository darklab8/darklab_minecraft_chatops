Pet project idea:

- Minecraft server deployable with infrastructure as a code
- with some backend keeping track of incoming and leaving server players -> counting current players online
- and attaching ChatOps bot to it:

  - If players all players are offline for more than 5 minutes = automaticlaly shutting down server
  - any player in discord server can boot it up by ChatOps command back online and join it
  - Thus. It would be my kind of small minecraft server among friends, yet with minimum payment, paying only for when some players are playing (edited)

Reasoning:

- Minecraft servers with fifty+ mods are kind of just too costy to server resources. Preferably they demand at least 4 CPU, 8 RAM even for small server for few people xD
- It will automatically also kind of solve a problem that minecraft server needs to be restarted at least once a day, due to all memory leaks xD
- Actually for next versions: make minecraft as service with panel to control and sell
